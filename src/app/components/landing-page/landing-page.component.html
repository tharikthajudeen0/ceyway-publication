        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>CEYWAY</strong> is an AI-powered mobile application that aims to revolutionize the tourism experience in Sri Lanka. Designed as a real-time, personalized itinerary generator, CEYWAY helps both local and international travelers plan their journeys efficiently and intuitively.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          With its integration of real-time data such as weather, traffic, local events, and crowd density, the app offers truly dynamic trip suggestions. Users can generate optimized travel plans based on their preferences, budget, available time, and desired experience — whether they seek adventure, culture, nature, or relaxation.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The application uses advanced generative AI models to tailor recommendations, supported by intuitive design for ease of use across different user demographics. CEYWAY also supports flexible transportation choices including public transport, private hires, and walking paths, offering complete control over travel style.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Ultimately, CEYWAY addresses a long-standing challenge in the tourism industry — the fragmentation of trip planning. It brings together scattered travel data into one unified, intelligent platform designed for seamless, smart, and satisfying travel in Sri Lanka.

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-purple-800 mb-6">Motivation</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The modern traveler seeks more than just destinations — they seek seamless experiences, convenience, and personalization. However, traditional travel planning is fragmented, requiring users to jump between multiple apps, websites, and services for weather updates, transport, accommodation, attractions, and budgeting.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        CEYWAY was inspired by the growing need for a unified platform that leverages real-time data and artificial intelligence to simplify this process. With digital expectations rising, especially among tech-savvy travelers, there's a critical need for tools that feel intuitive, adaptive, and intelligent.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        By addressing inefficiencies in existing solutions, CEYWAY aims to empower travelers with a smart assistant that understands their preferences and responds to real-world changes—enhancing the tourism experience in Sri Lanka while showcasing its full potential.

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-purple-800 mb-6">Project Scope</h2>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The CEYWAY project focuses on developing a cross-platform mobile application that delivers real-time, AI-enhanced travel planning specifically for Sri Lanka’s tourism industry. The app aims to provide travelers with dynamically generated, fully customized itineraries that adapt to their preferences and real-world conditions.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Core features include smart itinerary creation, live route optimization, and budget estimation based on transportation, accommodation, and activity costs. The platform integrates public and private transportation options, such as buses, trains, tuk-tuks, rental cars, and ride-shares.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        CEYWAY is designed to serve a wide range of users—from solo travelers to families and large groups, from locals to international tourists—supporting travel goals from leisure to business. The UI emphasizes minimal input and high usability, ensuring accessibility for all tech skill levels.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        This version of the project focuses on itinerary generation and real-time recommendations but does not yet include booking functionalities such as hotel or flight reservations. These features may be added in future iterations based on user feedback.

    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-purple-800 mb-6">Research Problem</h2>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Tourists often face fragmented, time-consuming, and inefficient trip planning due to the lack of centralized digital solutions. Essential travel details—such as transport, weather, attractions, and event info—are scattered across different platforms, making the process overwhelming and prone to error.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Existing mobile travel applications are typically narrow in scope, focusing on a single feature like hotel booking or navigation. They lack integration, personalization, and the ability to adapt to real-time data such as sudden weather changes, traffic disruptions, or local event updates.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Additionally, these platforms fail to provide cohesive transport planning across public and private systems or assist with accurate, real-world budgeting. This leaves travelers guessing and juggling between multiple sources during their trips.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        The absence of a smart, real-time, AI-based platform that consolidates all travel-related elements presents a major gap. Addressing this problem is critical for enhancing user satisfaction, efficiency, and the overall quality of the Sri Lankan tourism experience.
